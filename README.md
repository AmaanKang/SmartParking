## Smart Parking Lot

The application is built to ease the vehicle parking problem in designated lots. Each parking lot will have a QR code to scan at the entrance and then the driver will be directed towards an available spot.

The driver can decide to view the available parking on their own through app or they can choose to park at a spot recommended by the app.
